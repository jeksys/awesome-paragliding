MISSION OBJECTIVES.</span><span class="c1">&nbsp; Please don&#39;t try to impress with &quot;radical&quot; moves during SIV. &nbsp;Please don&#39;t try to do more than is asked. Bad launches; going off tow route into a lock-out attitude; winding a manoeuvre up into a cascade; riser twists, cravat, cocoon; reserve throws; &nbsp;and not making it back to the beach: are all unnecessarily dangerous. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Quick response times to radio commands and consistent, predictable and smooth deliberate entries and exits to SIV moves are preferable. &nbsp;If pilots are performing well, our goal should be to have: perfect launches; zero lock outs requiring no pre-mature cut-aways; good tow tracks for max altitude; clean deliberate SIV moves that do not cascade; a progression of SIV moves; and pilots bettering their beach landing accuracy throughout.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The goal of SIV is to teach you how to predict, prevent, identify, and recover from bad flight attitudes to normal flight. &nbsp;In decreasing order of preference! If you can correctly predict what action will lead to a bad flight attitude, you will likely never get into a bad flight attitude. &nbsp;SIV will also give some idea of altitudes required for recovery, and thus, reserve deployment situations.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This course is about having an extra tool set to deal with an emergency, rare occasion. &nbsp;Not about goofing off and routinely putting yourself into extreme situations over hard ground. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">This is NOT an Acro course, and be advised you need a minimum of 5 years experience, 1000 air hours and 10 or more successful SIVs before you can start to contemplate acro. &nbsp;Even then, any acro should always be over a lake, under instruction, with rescue boat on standby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c5 c10 c13">3. RADIOS. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Two fully charged LARGE MOTOROLA FRS (no mini-ones or other brands: they are unreliable!) and CHARGERSs. Also zip lock bags and duct tape so we can help try prevent electronics from damage should you go in lake. &nbsp;YOUR ABILITY TO HEAR COMMANDS DURING SIV IS LIFE CRITICAL. &nbsp;It is 100% your responsibility to ensure you only use the specified type radios and that you have two that you check the batteries before each launch and bring back-up hard batteries and keep the volumes at maximum. &nbsp; We will do some basic manoeuvres and test your hearing before the faster and more noisier &nbsp;ones. &nbsp;If at any point, you are in a manoeuvre for an excessive period, and don&#39;t hear anything: try twisting your head towards the radio to confirm, and if in doubt about altitude, exit the manoeuvre per briefing instructions. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c13 c5 c10">4. RESERVES.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you hit water hard enough it behaves like concrete. &nbsp;So imagine that the lake is instead a giant parking lot, where the main advantage is that if you throw your reserve, you won&#39;t end up lost in the forest hanging from a tree. &nbsp;Your Reserve must be freshly repacked for SIV as if the manoeuvre goes astray and is nonrecoverable, you will need to use your reserve. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c13 c5 c10">5. &nbsp;HOW TO DEPLOY: RESERVE DEPLOY MANTRA.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>1. </span><span class="c5">RELEASE</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the brake toggles. Your focus needs to be 100% on your reserve now, and</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">hands unobstructed, so you can act.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>2. </span><span class="c5">LOOK</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;for the reserve handle. Paragliding harnesses have a number of adjustment straps that can easily be confused with the parachute deployment handle in an emergency situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>3. </span><span class="c5">GRAB</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the reserve handle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>4. </span><span class="c5">PUNCH</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the handle up and forward, hard and to full extension, like your life depended on it. The reserve in its deploy bag will be hanging below the handle like a suitcase you are holding forward at arms length.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>6. </span><span class="c5">THROW</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;the deployment bag towards clear air, usually behind you. Throw the bag hard, as if your life depended on it, because it very well could. The extension of the bridal needs to occur hard enough to pop the stow on the deploy bag.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>7. </span><span class="c5">YANK</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;on the riser. This will help clear the stow on the deploy bag if it is locked, and also to spread the suspension lines and open the air channel if your canopy has not yet inflated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>8. (</span><span class="c5">REEL-IN</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;if necessary, if your deploy bag remains closed, pull your parachute back in with yanking movements and repeat steps 6-7 until parachute opens.)</span></p><p class="c2"><span>9. </span><span class="c5">LOW</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;= PLF if altitude is low, immediately prepare for PLF and impact.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>10. </span><span class="c5">HIGH</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;= DISABLE, COMPENSATE &amp; PLF if altitude is high, identify if your paraglider is</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">down-planning or competing with your reserve. If it is, go hand over hand on rear risers and lines until you have fabric in hands, compress in a ball between your legs. Assess wind drift for impact location. If drifting towards power lines, &ldquo;slip&rdquo; your reserve away by pulling on a riser/line away from the hazard and releasing once clear. If over water, unclip from harness and flare, jumping clear of gear, ready yourself for possible entanglement and need of hook knife. Prepare for PLF and impact.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c13 c5 c10">6. WATER LANDINGS.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you think you are going to descend into water, it is important to know that the lines and parachute can easily tie you up under water.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To help prevent this, disconnect your leg and chest straps in preparation for jumping free of the harness, just before you impact the water. Sit on the edge of your seat board (and if the paraglider is still overhead controllable, flare hard so that the paraglider stalls clean away and behind you) and lurch forward into the water, just before impact. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Depth perception can be very deceptive over water, so keep your eyes on the horizon and look for concrete clues to determine your altitude over water. Many skydivers have gotten seriously hurt or killed jumping into the water when they were too high. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Always have your hook knife ready in your hand. If you find yourself under water with your canopy overhead, try not to make any thrashing movements, remain calm with gentle, deliberate motions. Remember, there should be an air pocket trapped underneath and within the paraglider. Stay under water and swim away from your impact area.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c13 c5 c10">7. SIV SITUATIONS REQUIRING RESERVE DEPLOYMENT (we will call &quot;deploy, deploy, deploy your reserve&quot;).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If the pilot is cocooned in the paraglider fabric or is entangled in major lines, this is a definite reserve throw scenario regardless of altitude. Try &quot;swimming&quot; out of your canopy, pushing fabric away from yourself, and throwing into clear air away from canopy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Otherwise, a decision to deploy your reserve is based on three fundamental considerations: altitude, pilot focus, and glider attitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you are thousands of feet above the ground (altitude); and you sustain a asymmetric deflation leading to a cravat and subsequent spiral dive (glider attitude); but the g forces are not yet overwhelming so you are able to calmly respond (pilot focus): continue to try to fix the problems as per Simulation of Flight Incidents (SIV) training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If at any point the pilot focus decreases, you start to panic, the g-forces start to prevent your ability to move, or your field of vision narrows with black on the edges: you are dangerously close to falling unconscious: deploy your reserve regardless of altitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Many paraglider pilots use a critical altitude below which they will no longer attempt to correct the situation and automatically go for their reserve parachute. For our SIV training this will be 500ft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Riser twists with trapped brakes resulting in a cascade of spins, deep stall and stalls is a reserve throw situation below 500 ft.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A cravated spiraling glider will not recover within 500 ft &ndash; reserve should be thrown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Any deep spiral below 500 ft that the pilot has lost control of should result in a reserve toss.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In general, if the glider is diving at high speed and still violently out of control below 500 ft, and the pilot sees more ground than sky, the reserve should be thrown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you&#39;ve lost control of a manoeuvre below 500ft, and are unable to hear us on the radio, &nbsp;deploy your reserve. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c13 c5 c10">8. WHEN NOT TO THROW.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Asymmetric deflations less than 50%, full frontals and other incidents where the glider attitude remains overhead, which a pilot should be able to recover from with less than 500 ft, given that they have taken SIV training.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The following Bad Glider Attitudes result in the following descent rates, and ETAs to impact from 500 ft above ground level (AGL):</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&bull; Deepest Spiral Dive &ndash; 20 m/s &ndash; ex. cravated spiral &ndash; ETA 7.6 seconds - fatality most probable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&bull; Full Stall/Deep Stall/Spin cascade &ndash; 10 m/s or more &ndash; ex. riser twists with locked brakes &ndash;glider cascading from deep stall to stall, possibly spinning, with surges &ndash; ETA 15.2 seconds &ndash; serious injuries most probable, fatality possible.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&bull; Spin* stable &amp; overhead, Deep Stall* &ndash; 6 m/s or more descent rate &ndash; ex. over braked glider or too much asymmetric brake &ndash; ETA 25.4 seconds &ndash; injuries probable, if no PLF.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&bull; Asymmetric deflation* 50% stable &amp; overhead, Full frontal* deflation - 4 m/s or more descent rate &ndash; unchecked turbulence causes deflation - ETA 38 seconds &ndash; injuries possible if no PLF.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">* Note spins, deep stall, asymmetric deflations, frontal will only yield the lower descent rates if the dive is checked by the pilot, and the glider remains stable and overhead. Otherwise, higher descent rates, more in line with spiral dividing, will ensue, and serious injuries and even death can occur. Simulation of Flight Incidents (SFI/SIV) Training &nbsp;is essential so that pilots can maintain stability for these incidents, recover from them and minimize the need to throw below the 500 ft critical altitude. If loss of control occurs, or pilot has any doubt, reserve should still be thrown.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c13 c5 c10">9. TOWING.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">A few must haves for towing:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- hydraulic payout winch so that the tow tension adjusts to demand</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- a weak link on tow line so if pilot approaches lock out, link breaks and pilot is off tow</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- unbreakable glasses on pilots as if weak link breaks, bridal lines etc can become a whip up into your eyes</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- a quick release bridal for the pilot so they can cut a way at any time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- a hook knife in case above don&rsquo;t work or you have lines around you</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- life vests in case you hit the water unconscious </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- radios and clear body/hand signals between pilot and tow operator </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- freshly packed reserve parachutes, &nbsp;back protectors, gloves, &nbsp;helmets on all pilots</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">- a bail out plan and landing approach for cut-ways from tow</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c12 c13 c5 c10">10.

TOWING.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">1. Ready in forward launch position. &nbsp;Bow to indicate your readiness. Lean back bracing for onset of pressure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">2. Jet boat gets going, wait for tension in line to get pronounced.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">3. Tow line spotter drops towline and clears </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>4. Forward launch, but initially lean BACK resisting tow, run like hell, bring arms up and around to prevent frontal, do not sit prematurely, </span><span class="c5">add a touch of brake if lingering close to ground once airborne</span><span class="c1">. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">5. Critical to maintain flight path vertical, not turning toward beach tree line or lake. Any escalating turn: cut-away with bridal quick release before LOCK-OUT occurs. Then, if safe beach landing not possible, &nbsp;ditch into lake. &nbsp;You may need to do this swiftly on your own initiative. If instructor commands &quot;cut-away&quot; do so. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">6. Once clear and on good flight path can sit. It is harder to sit with a life vest on. Important to loosen your shoulder straps and other straps and adjust your harness during pre-flight to allow you to get in. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">7. Pay attention to flight path. &nbsp;Look up at wing a lot as you need to fly it actively all the time and it will behave slightly differently than usual. You cannot allow your wing to yaw off course and it does so easily. &nbsp;So you need to fly your wing around the full course of tow and it takes constant adjustment. If instructors command &quot;cut-away&quot; &nbsp;do so. &nbsp;If you cut way when away from the beach and with some altitude, it should be possible to immediately turn back to the beach and glide back. If not, prepare for water landing as above, and boat will be on its way to pick you up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">8. Tow boat will do an oval course with long axis along lake. &nbsp;You should fly always on the outside of the oval on the straight legs and on the outside of the oval &nbsp;curved sections (5-10 degrees) to keep the tow tension up. Let the boat lead the turn with you slightly slightly behind in your turns. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">9. Do not freak out if you are getting jerking sensations or noise in tow line, or if at altitude you are getting the tow line dropping at a weird angle: that is normal. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">10. When boat has got you to to altitude (generally after one full oval and once he is upwind of the beach again) you will hear the engine drop As the boat stops and the winch operator will hit rewind to take some slack out of the line...wait &nbsp;a few seconds for some of the slack to be taken up... then as line just starts to tighten...that is your signal to cut-away. &nbsp; We may also encourage you to do so if you haven&#39;t already &quot;cut-away&quot;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">11. Once you cut away, the drogue chute and line will fall away. &nbsp;If for some reason it doesn&#39;t, try again and check bridal pin has released. &nbsp;If you are unable to cut away after several attempts, use your hook knife to cut TOW BRIDAL ONLY. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">12.

SIV PROGRESSIONS.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The most deadly scenarios in paragliding are: cocooned; riser twists; cravat; deep spiral. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We won&#39;t deliberately attempt to simulate these three directly. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cocoon occurs when a pilot tumbles over their glider with insufficient energy, so the lines go slack and pilot falls into canopy. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DC8MKfBVspzQ&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1599081585492000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3PeosfCfmVi4FKECg0Od2R">Riser twists</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;occur when the wing spins more quickly than the pilot. &nbsp;That is why pod harnesses aren&#39;t great in turbulence: the pilot has a high polar moment of inertia, splayed out, versus a more compact upright position (acro harness), allowing him to spin quickly with the glider. &nbsp;Twists often lead to cascades: spin &gt; deepstall &gt; stall &gt; spin &gt; deep stall, and any combination oscillating between these, especially if the pilots brakes get trapped in a deep position, and thus, the glider can&#39;t surge to restart normal flight. If it does surge after an aggravated deeps stall or cascade, it often lurches to a deep spiral. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Cravat occurs if pilot doesn&#39;t check lines on launch, or during a large scale asymmetric collapse, the pilot lets surge ahead, and has his body weight fall towards, trapping a wing tip or more in the lines. &nbsp;It can also occur from any asymmetrically exited stall or spin. &nbsp; A large assymetric cravat leads to deep spiral dives. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">The majority of poorly executed SIV moves lead to an asymmetric dive and therefore spiral. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">So in our SIV progression we will start almost immediately with spiral to ensure you understand it, should it occur inadvertently after mistakes during other movements. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">We will custom tailor the course to your individual progression and comfort level. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>1. </span><span class="c3"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D7a8WYP-G20w&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1599081585494000&amp;usg=AOvVaw158ngg14Bzagut5eCZiwMe">&nbsp;Big Ears</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>2. </span><span class="c3"><a class="c7" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dbhs1GMaUpY8&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1599081585495000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1xpWFepbH0uGqw7iBVfmeV">&nbsp;Asymmetric Big Ears</a></span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">3.
