Go to Guest Services and say you are a paragliding pilot and show your current HPAC card.  You can also email it ahead of time email is [guestservices@sunpeaksresort.com](guestservices@sunpeaksresort.com)  They have a separate waiver for us.  Launch is between the top of the **Burfield Chair and Crystal Chair** (maintain 100 metres away from lifts).  Landings on any golf course fairway.

Sun Peaks Mgmt. wants us to land on the golf course during winter operations.  We have been landing on Hole 18 (close to the Village and lifts) and Hole 15 (close to our condos).

?: Are they requiring you ski launch? Or can you fly a pod? When I talked to the safety guy last year they seemed open to either, but I didnâ€™t end up going.

A: No restrictions how you launch

Hi Kevin, short answer is yes, the best SE launch requires skis to get there. There is another approved lower E  launch we can walk from the Sunburst.

Good news from Sun Peaks Guest Services - a day pass for $25 a day for non ski pilots that takes you up Sunburst Chair to the OSV Launch point. Ask for it after you do the waivers. If it is not launchable you can download on the same lift.

**Weather**

all winter sites are less predictable than summer. Launch is SE, at 2000m you want lights and clear skies. Landing are excellent. Come out and plan ski and bring your wing.

Summer in Sunpeaks is excellent flying and predictable. The valley collects big  thermals well. There is a west facing mtn range to Clearwater,  Valemount the can be explorered.

**Speedfying**

Speed flying not allowed. Sorry. Not a good hill for that.

Thanks to Jim Reich for organizing it
