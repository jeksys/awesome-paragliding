igcs are very simple, for the core data the only record that interests you is the B-record and they are really easy to figure out.

example for a B record ... it starts, oh wonder with a B:

B1422053412543N11718193WA0119700000

First part is time 142205 -> 14h22m05s

the comes the coordinates
3412543N -> 34°12.543' N
11718193W -> 117°18.193 W

then comes the altitude in meters, either one value or two values (GPS and barometric)
A0119700000 -> 1197m (GPS), 00000 barometric (i.e. no barometric data)

so it looks like i have been at marshall at 2:22pm that day Wink

i suppose there must be a real spec somwhere out there. tom you know any?
